# kudos-board
WORK IN PROGRESS 

Created the UI through Figma: 

This project was inspired by a group-building activity where students wrote down compliments on a sticky-note and hung them on a big white board. 

The main features will be a form  where users submit messages and a board containing the saved messages.

GOAL: 
- create a simple CRUD api to retrieve and to insert into a DB.
